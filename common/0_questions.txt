Is NodeJs Single threaded?
   - UV lib (libUV) uses thred pool internally
      - these is used in some modules
        eg: fs, crypto, dns lookup, http (get)
      - by defeault libUV uses 4 threds, we can change this by env variable

   - if we are not using libUV modules
        - then it is single threaded
        - else it is multi threaded
